	<h3>Summary Overview</h3>
	  <p> V1-In my website I am trying to present a website for baseball coaches and players can visit to help them become better players and coaches. What is presented in my website are images, both an ordered and unordered list,
	      a blirp about the website, change in font styles, colors(both background and text) and the use of CSS. In reflecting I am hoping I am on the right track with my website. I am having some challanges fully understanding some of the sections.</p>
	  <p> V2-2/11/2020- In this version I completly redesigned the website. Giving it more of a natural feel and free flowing process. Added in a background with a picture. Centered the main photo on the top of the page.
	      I also created a grid that allowed for a three row column. Making it easier on the eye. CSS has made a huge impact on my page by the ability to add rounded corners to pictures, text box shadowing, fixed positioning and just an overall better product.
		  The final thing is I added in a footer. </p> 
      <p> V3- 2/25/2020- In the newest version of V3 of my website I have only made some slight modifications. I added in a weekly schedual to show the days of the week, events on those days and times of the events. CSS effect it by allowing me to convert
          certain rows to either block out mulitple rows or change the colors to make them more visual. I also include a drop down bar that allows access to other sites and more coaching materials. I also intoduced a flexbox that CSS allowed me to use the wrap function and 
          I was able to create a list of my personal all time great baseball players in a very sleak fashion. I also updated my footer based on suggestions from my classmates. I did remove from the last version a picture and the strike zone section as at the time I was struggling with absolute and relative positioning. </p>		  
	  <p> V4- 3/14/2020- I complelty revamped the website. Adding a secondary background over my picture background. Making it easier to read for everyone. I also change the font color to all black to make it also easier to read.
	      I also changed the colors in my tables that makes it much more easier on the eyes. I also made three new pages to spread out the content and make it a lot simpler to navigate and enjoy. I also added in a registration form
		  that would allow people to sign up for events on my website. I also included on the index page a youtube video of the greatest catches in baseball.
